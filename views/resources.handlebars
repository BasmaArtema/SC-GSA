                        and Asexual or Ally. Although all of the different identities within “LGBT” are often lumped together (and share
                        sexism as a common root of oppression), there are specific needs and concerns related to each individual identity.

                    <dd>A person who generally does not feel sexual attraction or desire to any group of people. Asexuality is not the same as celibacy.</dd>

                    <dd>Typically any non-LGBT person who supports and stands up for the rights of LGBT people, though LGBT people can be allies, such as a lesbian who is an ally to a transgender person.</dd>
                    <dt>Androgyny</dt>
                    <dd>(1) a gender expression that has elements of both masculinity and femininity; (2) occasionally used in place of “intersex” to describe a person with both female and male anatomy.</dd>

                    <dd>The terms ‘submission/sadism’ and ‘masochism’ refer to deriving pleasure from inflicting or receiving pain, often in a sexual context. The terms ‘bondage’ and ‘domination’ refer to playing with various power roles, in both sexual and social context. These practices are often misunderstood as abusive, but when practiced in a safe, sane, and consensual manner can be a part of healthy sex life. (Sometimes referred to as ‘leather.’)</dd>

                    <dd>The most common definition of a ‘bear’ is a man who has facial/body hair, and a cuddly body. However, the word ‘bear’ means many things to different people, even within the bear movement. Many men who do not have one or all of these characteristics define themselves as bears, making the term a very loose one. ‘Bear’ is often defined as more of an attitude and a sense of comfort with natural masculinity and bodies.</dd>

                    <dd>A curiosity about having sexual relations with a same gender/sex person.</dd>

                    <dd>Aversion toward bisexuality and bisexual people as a social group or as individuals. People of any sexual orientation can experience such feelings of aversion.

                    <dd>A person who is attracted to both people of their own gender and another gender. Also called “bi”.</dd>

                    <dt>Lipstick Lesbian</dt>
                    <dd>Usually refers to a lesbian with a feminine gender expression. Can be used in a positive or a
                    derogatory way, depending on who is using it. Is sometimes also used to refer to a lesbian who is seen as
                    automatically passing for heterosexual.</dd>

                    <dt>Male Lesbian</dt>
                    <dd>A male-bodied person who identifies as a lesbian. This differs from a heterosexual male in that a
                    male lesbian is primarily attracted to other lesbian, bisexual or queer identified people. May sometimes identify as
                    gender variant, or as a female/woman. (See ‘Lesbian.’)</dd>

                    <dt>Metrosexual</dt>

                    heterosexual male with a strong aesthetic sense who spends a great deal of time and money on his appearance
                    and lifestyle. This term can be perceived as derogatory because it reinforces stereotypes that all gay men are
                    fashion-conscious and materialistic.</dd>

                    open relationships, polyfidelity (which involves multiple romantic relationships with sexual contact restricted to
                    those), and subrelationships (which denote distinguishing between a ‘primary&quot; relationship or
                    relationships and various &quot;secondary&quot; relationships).</dd>

                    <dt>Queer</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <ol>
                            <li>An umbrella term which embraces a matrix of sexual preferences, orientations, and habits of the not-
                    exclusively- heterosexual-and- monogamous majority. Queer includes lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transpeople,
                    intersex persons, the radical sex communities, and many other sexually transgressive (underworld) explorers.</li>

                    <li>This term is sometimes used as a sexual orientation label instead of ‘bisexual’ as a way of acknowledging that
                    there are more than two genders to be attracted to, or as a way of stating a non-heterosexual orientation without
                    having to state who they are attracted to.</li>

                    <li>A reclaimed word that was formerly used solely as a slur but that has been semantically overturned by members
                    of the maligned group, who use it as a term of defiant pride. ‘Queer’ is an example of a word undergoing this
                    process. For decades ‘queer’ was used solely as a derogatory adjective for gays and lesbians, but in the 1980s the
                    term began to be used by gay and lesbian activists as a term of self-identification. Eventually, it came to be used as
                    an umbrella term that included gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgendered people. Nevertheless, a sizable
                    percentage of people to whom this term might apply still hold ‘queer’ to be a hateful insult, and its use by
                    heterosexuals is often considered offensive. Similarly, other reclaimed words are usually offensive to the in-group
                    when used by outsiders, so extreme caution must be taken concerning their use when one is not a member of the
                    group.</li>

                    secondary sex characteristics and hormonal balances. Because usually subdivided into ‘male’ and ‘female’, this
                    category does not recognize the existence of intersexed bodies.</dd>

                    labeled based on the gender identity/expression of the person and who they are attracted to. Common labels:

                            <li>Generally when this term is used, it is being mistakenly interchanged with “sexual
                    orientation,” creating an illusion that one has a choice (or “preference”) in who they are attracted to;</li>

                            <li>The types of sexual intercourse, stimulation, and gratification one likes to receive and participate in</li>

                    <dd>A term used by some medical professionals to refer to a group of surgical
                    options that alter a person’s “sex”. In most states, one or multiple surgeries are required to achieve legal
                    recognition of gender variance. Also known as “Gender Confirming Surgery.”</dd>

                    <dd>A preconceived or oversimplified generalization about an entire group of people without regard for
                    their individual differences. Though often negative, can also be complimentary. Even positive stereotypes can have
                    a negative impact, however, simply because they involve broad generalizations that ignore individual realities.</dd>

                    <dd>A person who may or may not desire sexual penetration and/or contact with the genitals
