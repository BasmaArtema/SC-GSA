                            The goal, in any school system, is to provide an environment where students are encouraged to strive academically and reach their full potential. This group ties hand-in- hand with building self-
                            confidence, ensuring student safety, creating community acceptance, and enhancing academic growth across all programs of study. According to a study at the University of Calgary, Gay-
                            Straight Alliances are “one of the fastest growing social movements within schools in North America.” With a focus on positivity and acceptance, the St. Clair College Gay-Straight Alliance
                            will allow this school to remain relevant in its efforts to maintain a student focus.

                            Statistics show that youth who are harassed on the basis of sexual orientation are more than twice as likely to report depression and seriously consider suicide. They are also more likely to
                            receive low grades, smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs, and become victims of violence. Approximately 9 out of 10 students have reported hearing negative comments based on sexual
                            orientation within school hallways, and 2 out of every 3 students (who identify as LGBTQ) have reported being harassed based on actual, or perceived, sexual orientation. Nearly 60% of
                            heterosexual youth find homophobic comments to also be upsetting and a Gay-Straight Alliance at St. Clair College would promote solidarity amongst all students.
